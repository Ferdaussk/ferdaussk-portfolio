                    A portfolio of work similar in complexity to your needs is the key step in moving forward.
Depending on the type of website your small business requires, you’ll want to be confident your web developer has a portfolio of work in similar areas. If your business requires an eCommerce site and all their work is reflective of commercial photography and self-published authors, then it’s time to move on to the next expert.

                    Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a must-have for your website. Therefore any developer you work with should have an integrated plan for SEO to ensure that your business ranks high within search engine results.
What is their experience with SEO and will they offer training on how to optimize your website as you update and add to it on your own?

                  <h3>Can you train me how to update the site by myself? <i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i></h3>
                </div>

                    Another seriously important question for your web developer is about the future. Someday soon you will part ways, and when that happens, you’ll need to take care of your online business without them (unless you’re going to pay their firm for ongoing, pricey upkeep).

                    Not to sound paranoid but… Actually, it’s not paranoia at all but rather a sensible business practice to protect your online presence.
Ask if they will create a page with a custom error message that can limit any hacker’s ability to access the backend. If they are maintaining your server, will they provide updates? Will they secure your database and install an SSL certificate?
